Ever wondered how libraries keep track of thousands of books, borrowers, and records so seamlessly? Back in 10th grade, I set out to uncover that mystery — and build my very own digital librarian. The result? Library-Management-System, a Python-based project that brings the timeless organization of libraries into the digital age.

This project isn’t just about issuing and returning books — it’s about mastering the art of logic, structure, and efficiency. Designed and coded from scratch, it captures the essence of how real-world library systems function, while showcasing my early journey into software development and problem-solving.

If you’re looking for a simple, elegant, and functional library manager — one that embodies both the curiosity of a learner and the precision of a developer — this is the project that started it all.


## Features

- 📚 Book Management: Add, remove, and update book records effortlessly.
- 👤 Member Handling: Keep track of registered users and their borrowing histories.
- ⏱ Issue & Return System: Record transactions, due dates, and book availability.
- 🔍 Search Functionality: Instantly find books or members by title, author, or ID.
- 🧮 Data Persistence: Stores information locally for smooth and consistent operations.

Simple yet powerful, this system demonstrates the fundamentals of backend logic and database management — all built in Python!

## Usage
Run the script, log in as an admin or librarian, and explore a fully interactive system that simulates the operations of a real library.
```
  python library_management_system.py
```
From there, you can:
- Add new books
- Issue and return books
- Search the catalog
- Manage member records
It’s as simple as that — an entire library in your terminal!
